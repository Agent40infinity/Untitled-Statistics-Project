        "Player#1": "Hello?! Where the hell am I?! What in the world am I doing here?!",
        "#1": "*Poof*",
        "Professor#1": "Hello Player, I go by many names, but you can just call me 'The Professor', or just professor is also enough. You are currently here with me because our agents at our totally secret organization have realized that you've led a rather comfortable life. So comfortable that you've made statements in your life that completely disregards the misfortune of others in the world.",
        "Professor#2": "Therefore in order to shape you into a better global citizen, we will go on a journey to learn many new things about the United Nations and the UN Sustainability Goals (UNSDG) that have been set for humanity to transition to a much better world. And we'll also learn some statistics along the way!",
        "Samantha#1": "$CEIdle|$POS1|In conclusion, you've kidnapped me. What's your organization's name? I will be filing an official report with the police the second I get out of-",
        "Professor#2": "Calm down. We didn't kidnap you. At least not your physical body, we didn't. When you went to sleep, our agents activated a device to help us capture your consciousness and place us in a dream world where we can learn about the UNSDG goals in a perfectly simulated, safe and yet realistic world.",
        "Player#3" : "I literally could care less. Let me out! If I want to have a dream, it's gotta be something better than this. I don't need a patronizing dude called 'The Professor' to tell me how 'I have it easy'.",
        "Professor#3" : "Well, I am not patronizing you. And if you want out of this, the fastest way is to just cooperate with us and go on this journey with me. Whinging is just going to make this unnecessarily longer.",
        "Professor#4" : "Now, back to the topic at hand. The UNSDG is an important part of transitioning the world to be a better place. I have created a path for those who are lost and seek guidance on their journey. ",
        "Professor#5" : "And now I'll be guiding you through the memories of other individuals that I have had the honour to interview, and therefore can provide with you a sort of simulated interview for you to proceed with. Personally I call them memoram(s), but there is a longer and more technical name for it that I will not be using.",
        "Professor#6" : "Noow, in some cases, you will proceed with the simulation in a first-person perspective, meaning that you will have direct control over the person's behaviour and way of talking, and you will temporarily share their memories and thoughts, meaning you will be able to understand their background as if they are yours. ",
        "Professor#7" : "And in other simulations you will proceed in a third-person perspective, where you will experience the interview as if you are in the room with them, and you will only have partial control over their speeches, but in reality most of the dialogues are already predetermined.",
        "Professor#8" : "Now, since you want out of this as quickly as possible, why not also quickly choose which goals you want to learn first and go through it as quickly as you can. It will save you a lot of time not to be too hesitant about this.",

        "Professor#1": "Choosing Quality Education as our current topic now, are we? Good good. As per my observation you do seem to carry with you a sort of arrogance in the way you speak, which means you most likely chose this because….",
        "#1": "*Samantha cuts Professor off*",
        "Samantha#1" : "Of COURSE I would've received quality education, you have to be one of the stupidest things my head could ever make up in my entire life. You claim to be all-knowing but you don't even know about how I graduated top of my class.",
        "#2": "*Professor pauses time*",
        "Professor#2": "Now you are currently within the body of a person we have previously interviewed, Samantha Higgins. She is, as you can most likely guess since you currently inherit all her personalities and memories with how the memoram works, that she comes from a very comfortable background, and is top of her class in a prestigious high school and can also be very arrogant at times.",
        "Professor#3": "Now since you are doing this memoram in her perspective, you will have full access to her way of speaking, however, I would also highly recommend seeking more… polite alternatives when you are allowed the choices in your dialogue.",
        "Player#1": "But why?",
        "Professor#4": "Makes my life easier is all. Now, whenever you are ready. I will unpause and our conversation will start.",
        "Player#2": "Now why would I-",
        "Player#3": "Sure, let's get this over with I guess.",
        "#3": "*Professor unpause the time*",
        "Professor#5": "Yes, yes. If you would've let me finish my sentence I would've said what you just said. BUT I can sense within you a tinge of uncertainty…",
        "#4": "*Samantha cuts Professor off again*",
        "Samantha#2" : "Why am I even doing this? This is laughable considering I already AM thinking of studying in a university. ",
