          "Professor#2": "You are currently here with me because our agents at our totally secret organization have realized that you've led a rather comfortable life.",
          "Professor#3": "So comfortable that you've made statements in your life that completely disregards the misfortune of others in the world.",
          "Professor#4": "Therefore in order to shape you into a better global citizen, we will go on a journey to learn many new things about...",
          "Professor#5": "...the United Nations and the UN Sustainability Goals (UNSDG) that have been set for humanity to transition to a much better world. ",
          "Professor#6": "And we'll also learn some statistics along the way!",
          "Player#2": "In conclusion, you've kidnapped me. What's your organization's name?",
          "Player#3": "I will be filing an official report with the police the second I get out of-",
          "Professor#7": "Calm down. We didn't kidnap you.",

          "Professor#9": "When you went to sleep, our agents activated a device to help us capture your consciousness and place us in a dream world...",
          "Professor#10": "...where we can learn about the UNSDG goals in a perfectly simulated, safe and yet realistic world.",
          "Player#4": "I literally could care less. Let me out!",
          "Player#5": "If I want to have a dream, it's gotta be something better than this.",

          "Professor#11": "Well, I am not patronizing you.",
          "Professor#12": "And if you want out of this, the fastest way is to just cooperate with us and go on this journey with me.",
          "Professor#13": "Whinging is just going to make this unnecessarily longer.",
          "Professor#14": "Now, back to the topic at hand.",
          "Professor#15": "The UNSDG is an important part of transitioning the world to be a better place.",
          "Professor#16": "I have created a path for those who are lost and seek guidance on their journey.",
          "Professor#17": "And now I'll be guiding you through the memories of other individuals that I have had the honour to interview,...",
          "Professor#18": "...and therefore can provide you with a sort of simulated interview for you to proceed with.",
          "Professor#19": "Personally I call them <b>memoram</b>(s), but there is a longer and more technical name for it that I will not be using.",
          "Professor#20": "Now, in some cases, you will proceed with the simulation in a first-person perspective.",
          "Professor#21": "Meaning that you will have direct control over the person's behavior and way of talking...",
          "Professor#22": "...and temporarily share their memories and thoughts.",
          "Professor#23": "Which means you will be able to understand their background as if they are yours.",
          "Professor#24": "And in other simulations you will proceed in a third-person perspective,...",
          "Professor#25": "...where you will experience the interview as if you are in the room with them,...",
          "Professor#26": "...having only  partial control over their speeches, with predetermined dialogues.",
          "Professor#27": "Now, since you want out of this as quickly as possible,...",
          "Professor#28": "...why not also quickly choose which goals you want to learn first and go through it as quickly as you can.",

          "Narrator#2": "*Professor pauses time*",
          "Professor#4": "Now you are currently within the body of a person we have previously interviewed, Samantha Higgins.",
          "Professor#5": "She is, as you can most likely guess since you currently inherit all her personalities and memories,...",
          "Professor#6": "...from a very comfortable background, top of her class in a prestigious high school and is very arrogant at times.",
          "Professor#7": "Now since you are doing this <b>memoram</b> in her perspective, you will have full access to her way of speaking.",
          "Professor#8": "However, I would also highly recommend seeking more... polite alternatives when you are allowed the choices in your dialogue.",
          "Player#1": "#CEIdle|$POS1|But why?",
          "Professor#9": "Makes my life easier is all. Now, whenever you are ready. I will unpause and our conversation will start.",
          "Player#2": "Now why would I-",
          "Player#3": "Sure, let's get this over with I guess.",

          "Professor#10": "Yes, yes. If you would've let me finish my sentence I would've said what you just said. ",

          "Professor#12": "Are you now? Then you will have nothing to worry about then. This will just be right up your alley.",
          "Professor#13": "Now if you don't mind answering my question.",
          "Samantha#4": "As a matter of fact I DO mind answering your question actually. Maybe if you would just let me OUT of this stupid-",
          "Narrator#5": "*Professor cuts Samantha off*",
          "Professor#14": "Great. Glad to hear such ardor from you. ",
          "Professor#15": "Now from what I understand, you are already considering pursuing a higher education BUT now I understand your uncertainty.",
          "Professor#16": "You think it might not be worth it for you to study any further...",
          "Professor#17": "...and that pursuing an education in a male-dominated field won't be worth it.",
          "Samantha#5": "I never said anything about that. Are you reading my mind? ",
          "Samantha#6": "You are ridiculous. I am not the one that thinks studying any further could be a waste of time.",
          "Samantha#7": "My brother is the one that's thinking that. ",
          "Samantha#8": "And of course he would think that too.",
          "Samantha#9": "He almost flunked out of year 9 and now he is talking about how he should just join TAFE to pursue a “trade” in plumbing.",
          "Samantha#10": "Talk about being the family failure.",
          "Samantha#11": "This is why I HAD to consider studying in STEM in the first place. Somebody's gotta make the family proud.",

          "Professor#19": "Let's not persecute your brother right away. ",
          "Professor#20": "From what I can observe, your brother isn't doing that badly in terms of his grades. ",
          "Professor#21": "He can even choose to pursue a university degree if he puts his mind to it. ",
          "Professor#22": "The problem stems from him thinking that it's pointless as if he gets his qualification from TAFE...",
          "Professor#23": "...he can join the workforce and start earning money right away, rather than having to incur student debt. ",
          "Professor#24": "Well, let's go ahead and find out whether his way of thinking is true or not.",
